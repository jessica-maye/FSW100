            Today we argued after I cooked this fool shrimp. I cant concentrate 
            on what I want to say but, he is sad. He is not happy and I guess that
            helps me feel better. He is finally understanding that he needs to just
            figure out life and it is cute because he is trying. The devil is a liar! 
            No matter what is going on in life, IT CAN CHANGE

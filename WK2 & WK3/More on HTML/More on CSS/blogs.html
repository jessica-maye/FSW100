    I will blog my life away
</p>

<p class="cake">
    What I remember first was, telling my mom "No I Was."
</p>
<p class="cake">
  Then my mom invited my sister in the room, to force the truth. 
</p>
<p class="cake">
  After that, I was not able to see my grandma. 
</p> 
<p class="cake">
  Maybe it was a couple months
</p> <p class="cake">
But when I did, she looked sick. She was crying and drained.
</p>
<p class="cake">
It was my brother's football game and she was standing by a tree.
</p>

<p class="cake">
No one else was around and she wanted to run to me, I could tell.
</p>
<p class="cake">
"Jessica, tell me what happened," she whispered out.
</p>
<p class="cake">
I was thinking, "how could you now know?" But then again how would anyone?

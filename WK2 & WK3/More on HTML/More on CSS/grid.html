            after talking to my mom, I am forever from getting my son. Like this is not fair. Everytime
            I say or do something it turns out to be wrong. I feel I have too many enemies and 
            I cannot focus. 
        </td>
        <td class="cake">God I am asking you to change me and mold me. I want to live along and not be bothered. 
            I have went to the hospital and I feel different but for some reason the same things are still occuring. 
            I want him to understand that we are better alone. I do just for the sake of our son. 
        </td>
       
    <tr>
 
        <td class="cake">When will I be a mom again? I mean it may take a year but it will happen.
            Just do not do anything stupid anymore. It is no longer just about you and him it is about 
            what you know Julian will be privey to. Just keep up the strength and understanding. 
        </td>
        <td class="cake">God I did something that hurt me. How could I be so confused? How could I let
            this happen agin? I thought it was the right thing honestly. Gpd please do not let me hurt 
            anymore, or let me do anything stupid.

<li class="newbox">I would like to understand why I am going in circles. I feel like at times 
when I want an explanation for that. I feel my wrist vibrate, I look down at the apple watch. 
Brittney completed a workout. I text her back, girl why didnt you remind me?
Okay, so I just need friendly reminders and when I dont get reminders then 
I fall short.

<li class="secondbox"> Today I should be a little bit more tired after standing six hours. I am
    not too sure how my life is going and honestly do not care because I want my son. I do not like
    what my mother is saying to me. I feel she is trying to provoke me.

<li class= "newbox"> I guess that explains why I get so frustrated with Jessie. 
We're having a long talk, and I think it's drawn out. I just don't want 
to be in a relationship. I am hot, we have no airconditioning. I can not tell
if Jessie is being sincere or not.

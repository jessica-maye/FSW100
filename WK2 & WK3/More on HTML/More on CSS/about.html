My name is Jessica Lynn Maye and I have 2 kids and am currently married. I do not want to be married to the 
person I am married to but... I am. I wonder why that is the second thing I would like to notate. I think its because
I want to save him and others because we are no good togther. We are toxic and it was proven throughout the 
whole 3 years together. I mean its pretty much been four years but yeah. I also would like to notate that I am 
overweight. I am back in the weight scale of 200lbs but I guess it also comes with the height. I would like to notate also 
that I am not that confident in my looks because of my weight but that is something I am actively working on, so that's a 
plus.
